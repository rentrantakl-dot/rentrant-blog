Finding a flat in NZ can feel like a full-time job. Between the viewings, the applications, and the competition, it's easy to get caught up in the rush and sign on the dotted line before you've really checked things out.

Here's what we reckon you should look for before committing.

## 1. Check the moisture levels

Kiwi homes have a reputation for being cold and damp. Before you sign, look for:

- Condensation on windows
- Musty smells in cupboards and wardrobes
- Dark spots on walls or ceilings (hello, mould)
- How the place feels on a cold day

If something feels off, trust your gut.

## 2. Test the water pressure

Nothing worse than a dribble when you're trying to have a shower. Turn on the taps and flush the toilet. Check if the hot water runs out quickly.

## 3. Look at the heating situation

What heating is available? A heat pump is sweet, but a single bar heater in a draughty villa is gonna cost you.

Ask about:
- Type of heating
- Insulation (it's legally required in ceilings and underfloor, but check anyway)
- Double glazing

## 4. Check the outdoor spaces

If there's a yard, who maintains it? Is there secure storage for bikes? What about laundry facilities?

## 5. Read the fine print

We know, we know. But seriously:
- What's the bond situation?
- Any letting fees? (These are banned now, but dodgy landlords still try)
- What's the process for getting repairs done?
- Can you have pets?
