Kia ora! 👋

We're stoked to launch the RentRant Blog – your spot for updates, tips, and the occasional rant about the NZ rental market.

## What we're about

RentRant is a privacy-first platform where renters can share honest insights about properties. No names, no drama, just structured data that helps the next person make better decisions.

## What you'll find here

- **Renting tips**: Practical advice for navigating the rental jungle
- **Product updates**: What we're building and why
- **Community stories**: Real experiences from Kiwi renters (anonymised, of course)
- **Market insights**: Trends and data from our ratings

## Why we're doing this

Finding a good flat in NZ shouldn't feel like a gamble. We've all been there – moving into what looked like a sweet place, only to discover the shower pressure's munted, there's mould in the wardrobe, and the landlord takes three weeks to fix anything.

RentRant gives you the intel before you sign.

## Get involved

- [Rate a property](https://rentrant.nz) you've lived in

Cheers,
The RentRant Team
