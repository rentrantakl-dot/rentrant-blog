You just got the email. Or the letter. Or the text.

"We're increasing your rent to $XXX per week, effective [date]."

It's one of those moments where your stomach drops a bit, even if you knew it was coming. You've been here a while, you're settled, and now you're staring at an extra $40 or $60 a week — money you'd rather keep.

Here's the thing: a rent increase isn't always the end of the conversation. Sometimes it's the beginning of one.

This guide covers what you're legally entitled to, how to assess whether the increase is fair, and what you can actually do about it — including when it's worth pushing back and when it's probably not.

## The rules: what landlords can and can't do

Rent increases in New Zealand are regulated. Landlords can't just raise it whenever they feel like it, by whatever amount they want.

### Timing: once every 12 months

Your rent can only be increased **once every 12 months** from either:
- The start of your tenancy, or
- The date of your last rent increase

If you moved in in April 2025 and paid rent of $600/week, the earliest your landlord can increase it is April 2026.

### Notice: 60 days minimum

The landlord must give you at least **60 days' written notice** before the increase takes effect.

The notice must include:
- The new rent amount
- The date it takes effect

If they don't give enough notice, the increase isn't valid — and the old rent continues to apply until proper notice is given.

### Amount: there's no cap, but...

There's no legal limit on how much the rent can be increased by. However, the increase must be "in line with market rent." In practice, this means the landlord can't jack it up to a level that's clearly out of step with comparable properties in the area.

> The absence of a rent cap doesn't mean anything goes. "Market rent" is both a constraint and your main lever if you want to challenge an increase.

---

## Step 1: Check if the increase is valid

Before you decide how to respond, make sure the notice is actually correct.

**Questions to ask:**

1. **Has it been 12 months since your last increase (or tenancy start)?** If not, the increase isn't valid yet.

2. **Was the notice delivered in writing at least 60 days before the effective date?** Text and email count, but the notice must be clear. Verbal notice doesn't count.

3. **Does the notice include both the new rent amount and the effective date?** If it's vague — "we'll be increasing the rent soon" — it's not valid.

If the notice fails any of these tests, you can politely point that out. The increase won't take effect until proper notice is given.

---

## Step 2: Figure out if it's fair

This is the key question. Even if the increase is legally valid, that doesn't mean you have to accept it without understanding whether it reflects actual market conditions.

### Use the Market Rent Tool

The Tenancy Services [Market Rent Tool](https://www.tenancy.govt.nz/rent-bond-and-bills/market-rent/) gives you data on what tenants are actually paying for comparable properties in your area. It's based on bond lodgements — real rents, not asking prices.

Filter by:
- Suburb (not just Auckland — your specific neighbourhood)
- Property type (flat, house, unit)
- Number of bedrooms

This gives you a median and a range. If your landlord is trying to push you above the upper quartile for your area, you have something concrete to point to.

### Check current listings

Open Trade Me and search for similar properties in your area right now. How do they compare to what you're being asked to pay?

If comparable flats are sitting at $580/week and your landlord wants to increase you to $640/week, ask yourself: could I rent something equivalent for less? If yes, that's leverage.

### Consider the market context

The 2025-2026 rental market in Auckland has been softer than previous years. Nationally, average rents fell slightly for the first time in a decade. Vacancy rates are higher.

This matters because landlords have less power than they did in 2022. If your landlord is trying to push a big increase in a soft market, they're betting you won't notice — or won't push back.

---

## Step 3: Decide whether to accept, negotiate, or challenge

You have three options:

### Option A: Accept the increase

Sometimes it's not worth fighting. If the increase is small, it's in line with market rent, and you're otherwise happy in the tenancy, paying an extra $15-20/week might be less hassle than moving.

That's a legitimate choice.

### Option B: Negotiate

If you think the increase is on the high side but not outrageous, you can negotiate.

This works best when:
- You've been a good tenant (on time with rent, no complaints)
- The property has issues that reduce its value (poor heating, deferred maintenance, etc.)
- The market has comparable properties available for less
- The landlord wants to avoid the cost and hassle of finding a new tenant

**How to negotiate:**

Write a calm, factual response. Not emotional, not demanding — just practical.

**Example email:**

> Hi [Landlord/Property Manager],
>
> Thanks for letting me know about the rent increase. I've had a look at the market data, and I have some concerns about the amount.
>
> According to the Tenancy Services market rent tool, comparable 2-bedroom flats in [suburb] are currently renting at a median of $XXX/week. The proposed increase to $YYY would put this property above the upper quartile for the area.
>
> I've been a reliable tenant — rent paid on time, property well looked after — and I'd like to stay. However, I'd appreciate discussing a smaller increase that's more in line with current market conditions.
>
> Would you be open to [proposed amount] as a compromise?
>
> Cheers,
> [Your name]

Attach a screenshot of the market rent data if you've got it. Being prepared shows you're serious.

**What you might get:**

Landlords don't have to agree to negotiate. But many will, because:
- Finding new tenants costs money (advertising, agent fees, potential void period)
- Existing good tenants are valuable
- They know the market data is public and a Tribunal challenge is possible

A partial win — e.g., $30/week instead of $50/week — is still a win.

### Option C: Challenge through the Tribunal

If the increase is significantly above market rent and the landlord won't negotiate, you can take it to the Tenancy Tribunal.

**What the Tribunal does:**

The Tribunal can assess whether the rent increase is in line with market rent. If they find it's excessive, they can:
- Order the landlord to reduce the increase
- Set a "market rent" amount that applies going forward

**How it works:**

1. You apply to the Tribunal (there's a fee, currently around $20)
2. Both parties present evidence on market rent (recent listings, bond data, property condition)
3. The adjudicator makes a determination

**Is it worth it?**

Honestly, it depends on the amount and your situation. If the landlord is trying to extract an extra $50-80/week above market, the Tribunal route can pay off. If it's a $20/week disagreement, the time and stress might not be worth it.

And there's a new wrinkle to consider...

## The 2025 law change: 90-day no-cause termination

Since 30 January 2025, landlords can again terminate periodic tenancies with **90 days' notice without giving a reason**. This is a significant change from the previous rules, which required a specific reason (like selling the property or moving in themselves). At the same time, the notice period for tenants to end a periodic tenancy was reduced from 28 days to 21 days.

**Why this matters for rent negotiations:**

In theory, if you make too much noise about a rent increase, a landlord could just give you 90 days' notice and find a new tenant.

In practice, most landlords won't do this if you negotiate reasonably. Finding new tenants is expensive and risky. But it's worth knowing the landscape.

**What this means for your approach:**

- Be calm and factual, not combative
- Frame negotiations as a "let's find something that works for both of us" conversation
- Don't issue ultimatums unless you're actually prepared to move

> The new 90-day notice power doesn't mean landlords hold all the cards. Turnover is expensive for them too. But it does mean you should negotiate like a grown-up, not a crusader.

## Practical tips for the conversation

If you're going to push back on a rent increase, here's how to do it effectively:

### Be prompt

Respond within a week of receiving the notice. Leaving it until the last minute looks like you've already accepted and are now just complaining.

### Be specific

Don't just say "that seems high." Point to specific data. "The market rent tool shows comparable properties at $X. Here's a screenshot."

### Acknowledge the relationship

If you've been a good tenant, say so. If you've handled minor maintenance yourself, mention it. Landlords value tenants who don't cause drama.

### Propose, don't just object

Instead of "I don't agree with this increase," try "Would you consider $X instead?" A concrete proposal is easier to respond to.

### Know your alternatives

Before you negotiate, look at what else is available. If you genuinely have other options, you negotiate from a position of strength. If the market is tight and there's nothing else out there, you might need to be more flexible.

## When it's time to move on

Sometimes the answer is just to leave.

If the increase is substantial and there are better options available, moving might make sense — especially if:

- The landlord is unresponsive or difficult
- The property has ongoing issues (maintenance, Healthy Homes compliance, etc.)
- You're on a periodic tenancy and can leave with 21 days' notice

Do the maths. If moving costs you two weeks' rent plus $500 in movers and hassle, but you'll save $40/week, you'll break even in about six months. Sometimes it's worth it.

## Quick reference: your rent increase checklist

**Before responding:**
- [ ] Has it been 12 months since your last increase (or tenancy start)?
- [ ] Did you receive written notice with 60+ days lead time?
- [ ] Does the notice specify the new amount and effective date?

**Assessing the increase:**
- [ ] Check the Market Rent Tool for your area and property type
- [ ] Compare current listings on Trade Me
- [ ] Consider the property's actual condition (does it justify high-end rent?)

**Negotiating:**
- [ ] Respond in writing, calmly and factually
- [ ] Provide market data to support your position
- [ ] Propose a specific alternative amount
- [ ] Keep a copy of all correspondence

**If all else fails:**
- [ ] Consider Tenancy Tribunal if the increase is significantly above market
- [ ] Evaluate whether moving makes financial sense
