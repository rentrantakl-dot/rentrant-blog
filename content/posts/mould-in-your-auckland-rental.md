You've noticed the spots. In the corner of the bedroom ceiling. Around the bathroom window frame. Behind the couch.

Auckland and mould have a long, unhappy relationship. Our humid subtropical climate, combined with decades of poorly insulated housing stock, creates perfect conditions for the stuff to thrive. And if you've rented in Auckland for any length of time, you've probably dealt with it.

But here's what most tenants don't realise: mould isn't just your problem to manage. In many cases, it's a sign that the property doesn't meet legal standards — and your landlord is responsible for fixing it.

This guide covers how to identify mould problems, when it's the landlord's responsibility (and when it might be yours), how to document the issue properly, and what tenants have actually won at the Tenancy Tribunal.

## Why Auckland rentals grow mould

Let's start with the physics, because it matters.

Mould needs three things: warmth, moisture, and something to grow on. Auckland provides the first two reliably for about eight months of the year. The third — organic surfaces like timber, plasterboard, paint, carpet — is basically everything your flat is made of.

**The condensation problem:**

When warm, moist air hits a cold surface — like a single-glazed window, an uninsulated exterior wall, or a cold ceiling corner — it condenses into water. That water feeds mould.

This is why you see mould on:
- Window frames and sills
- Ceiling corners (especially in bedrooms)
- Behind furniture against exterior walls
- Bathroom ceilings and walls

**The insulation connection:**

Better insulation keeps surfaces warmer, which reduces condensation. Better heating lets you warm the air, which reduces relative humidity. Better ventilation lets moisture escape before it condenses.

Properties that fail on any of these — cold, underheated, poorly ventilated — are essentially mould farms.

## Whose problem is it? Landlord vs tenant responsibility

This is where it gets murky, and where landlords often try to shift blame. Let's be clear about the law.

### What the landlord is responsible for:

Under the Residential Tenancies Act and the Healthy Homes Standards, landlords must:

1. **Provide adequate heating** — A fixed heater in the main living room capable of heating to at least 18°C
2. **Provide adequate insulation** — Ceiling and underfloor insulation meeting minimum standards
3. **Provide adequate ventilation** — Opening windows, extractor fans in kitchen and bathroom
4. **Ensure no moisture ingress** — The property must be free from water entering through the roof, walls, or floor
5. **Ensure adequate drainage** — No pooling water around the property

If mould is caused by a failure in any of these areas — poor insulation, inadequate heating, missing extractor fans, a leaking roof, rising damp — **that's the landlord's problem**.

### What the tenant is responsible for:

Tenants have a duty to keep the property "reasonably clean and tidy" and to ensure adequate ventilation during normal use.

This means:
- Using extractor fans when cooking and showering
- Opening windows regularly to air the property
- Not blocking vents or windows
- Not drying excessive amounts of laundry indoors without ventilation
- Wiping down condensation on windows

**But here's the key point:** if you're doing all of that and mould is still appearing, the problem is structural — and that's on the landlord.

> "Just open the windows more" is not a valid response to a property with inadequate heating, poor insulation, or missing ventilation. You can't ventilate your way out of a building defect.

## The Healthy Homes connection

Since July 2025, all rentals must comply with the Healthy Homes Standards. Several of these standards directly affect mould risk.

### Ventilation standard

- Kitchen extractor must vent to outside (recirculating rangehoods don't count)
- Bathroom must have either an extractor venting outside OR an openable window of at least 300mm × 300mm
- All habitable rooms must have openable windows

If your rental doesn't meet these requirements, mould appearing in the kitchen or bathroom is likely linked to that failure.

### Moisture ingress standard

- No water should be entering from the roof, walls, or ground
- Gutters and downpipes must be functional
- No visible signs of persistent dampness

If you're seeing damp patches on walls, efflorescence (white powdery stuff) on concrete, or water stains on ceilings — that's moisture ingress, and it's a compliance failure.

### Heating and insulation standards

Inadequate heating and poor insulation make surfaces cold, which causes condensation, which feeds mould. A complaint about mould often uncovers broader Healthy Homes issues.

## How to document mould properly

If you're going to raise this with your landlord — or potentially take it to the Tribunal — you need evidence. Vague complaints won't get you anywhere.

### Take photos

- **Timestamped:** Make sure your phone's date stamp is visible, or include a newspaper with the date in the shot
- **Location clear:** Show enough context to identify where in the property the mould is
- **Close-ups and wide shots:** Both the detail of the mould and its position in the room

### Keep a written log

Note down each time you notice mould appearing or spreading:
- Date
- Location
- What it looked like
- Any actions you took (wiping it down, using anti-mould spray)

This shows the problem is persistent, not a one-off.

### Record any communications

Every time you contact your landlord about the issue:
- Do it in writing (email is best)
- Keep copies of their responses
- Note if they don't respond

A paper trail is critical if things escalate.

### Note your own behaviour

If you want to pre-empt the "you didn't ventilate enough" defence, document:
- That you use the extractor fans when cooking/showering
- How often you open windows
- That you're not drying excessive laundry indoors

---

## What to do: step by step

### Step 1: Report it to your landlord

Put it in writing. Be specific and factual.

**Example email:**

> Hi [Landlord/Property Manager],
>
> I'm writing to report a mould issue at the property.
>
> I've noticed mould appearing in the following locations:
> - Bedroom ceiling corner (see attached photo)
> - Around the bathroom window frame (see attached photo)
>
> I've been ventilating the property regularly — using the extractor fans when cooking and showering, opening windows daily — but the mould keeps returning. I believe this may be related to insulation or ventilation issues with the property.
>
> Could you please arrange an inspection and advise how you intend to address this?
>
> Cheers,
> [Your name]

Attach photos. Keep a copy.

### Step 2: Follow up if no response

If you don't hear back within a week, follow up. Still nothing after two weeks? Put it in writing that you'll be contacting Tenancy Services or considering a Tribunal application if there's no response.

### Step 3: Consider a Tribunal application

If the landlord refuses to act, denies responsibility, or the problem persists despite their attempts to fix it, you can apply to the Tenancy Tribunal.

**What you can claim:**

- An order requiring the landlord to remediate the mould and fix the underlying cause
- Compensation for any costs you've incurred (cleaning supplies, medical costs if you've been affected)
- Rent reduction for the period the property wasn't in a reasonable state
- Exemplary damages for breach of Healthy Homes Standards (up to $7,200 for smaller landlords, or up to $50,000 for larger landlords)

## Real Tribunal cases: what tenants have won

The Tribunal takes mould seriously, especially since the Healthy Homes Standards came into full effect. Here are some real examples:

### The $8,957 Kāinga Ora case

A Wellington tenant successfully claimed against Kāinga Ora (Housing New Zealand) for a property with damp and mould issues, inadequate heating, and insulation deficiencies. The Tribunal awarded:
- $8,000 in exemplary damages
- $957 in rent reduction
- Orders requiring full compliance

### Rent reductions for unliveable conditions

In multiple cases, Auckland tenants have been awarded **20-40% rent reductions** for periods where mould made their rental unhealthy. The logic: if the property isn't fit for purpose, you shouldn't be paying full rent.

### Orders to fix the source

The Tribunal frequently orders landlords to not just clean the mould, but fix the underlying cause — install insulation, fix ventilation, repair leaks. A landlord who just wipes down the mould and calls it done can face further action.

> The Tribunal doesn't accept "it's Auckland, mould happens" as a defence. Landlords are expected to provide properties that meet the Healthy Homes Standards. If they don't, there are consequences.

## Practical mould management while you wait

While you're waiting for your landlord to act (or deciding what to do), here's how to manage mould in the meantime:

### What to clean it with

- **White vinegar:** Mix equal parts vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Spray, leave for an hour, wipe. Effective for surface mould.
- **Commercial mould killer:** Available at supermarkets. Follow instructions.
- **Bleach:** Works but releases harsh fumes. Use in well-ventilated areas only.

### Where to focus

- Window frames and sills — wipe down condensation daily during winter
- Bathroom ceiling — run the extractor fan during and after showers
- Bedroom corners — check regularly, improve airflow if possible

### What not to do

- **Don't just paint over mould.** It'll come back through the paint.
- **Don't ignore it.** Mould spreads and can affect your health, especially if you have respiratory issues.
- **Don't assume it's your fault.** If you're ventilating properly and the problem persists, the building is the issue.

---

## Health impacts: when mould becomes a health matter

Mould isn't just unsightly. It can genuinely affect your health, especially:

- Respiratory issues (asthma, allergies, sinus problems)
- Skin irritation
- Headaches
- Fatigue

If you or someone in your household has health issues that you suspect are linked to mould, see a doctor. Medical records can strengthen a Tribunal claim.

> If mould is affecting your health, document the medical visits. A GP note linking respiratory symptoms to the property's condition is powerful evidence.

---

## Prevention: for when you have some control

If you're checking out a new rental, look for these mould risk factors:

- **Single glazing** — condensation magnet
- **South-facing bedrooms** — cold, get less sun, higher risk
- **No extractor fan in bathroom** — steam goes nowhere
- **Visible damp or musty smell** — obvious red flag
- **Cold corners** — touch the ceiling corners. If they're cold, they'll condense.

If you're already in a tenancy:

- **Move furniture slightly away from exterior walls** — allows air to circulate and prevents hidden mould
- **Use the extractor fans** — every time, not just when it's really steamy
- **Open windows daily** — even in winter, even for 10 minutes
- **Wipe down window condensation** — tedious but effective

---

## The bottom line

Mould in Auckland rentals is common, but it's not something you just have to accept.

If your flat grows mould despite you doing the right things — ventilating, heating, wiping down condensation — the problem is structural. And structural problems are the landlord's responsibility.

Document the issue. Raise it in writing. Push for a proper fix, not just a wipe-down. And if your landlord won't act, know that the Tribunal is there and that tenants are winning real compensation.

Living in a healthy home isn't a luxury. It's the legal minimum.
