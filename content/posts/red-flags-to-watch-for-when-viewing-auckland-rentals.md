You've scored a viewing. The listing looked decent — good photos, reasonable rent, location works. Now you're standing in someone else's flat, trying to decide if this could be your home for the next year. And you've got maybe 15 minutes before the agent moves on to the next group.

That's not a lot of time to spot the stuff that'll matter six months from now.

Most rental viewings in Auckland are a bit theatrical. The curtains are open, the place is empty and clean, maybe there's a plug-in air freshener working overtime. What you're seeing is the best this place will ever look. Your job is to see past that — to the things they're hoping you won't notice.

## The 15-minute problem

Open homes aren't designed for due diligence. They're designed for throughput. Agents want to process as many potential tenants as possible, take some applications, and move on.

This means you need to know what you're looking for before you walk in. You won't have time to figure it out on the spot.

What follows is a checklist — the things worth checking in the limited time you've got. Some of these are deal-breakers. Others are negotiation points. A few are just useful context for your decision.

## Moisture and mould: the big one

Auckland's humid subtropical climate makes moisture management genuinely difficult. Even well-maintained properties can struggle with condensation. Poorly maintained ones? They grow science experiments.

**Check these spots:**

- **Window frames and corners** — look closely at the silicone seals and into the corners of the glass. Dark spots = mould. Peeling paint or bubbling around the frame = water getting in.
- **Ceiling corners** — especially in bedrooms and bathrooms. Look for dark patches or tide marks. If you can see it during a viewing, imagine what it looks like in winter.
- **Under the sink** — in both kitchen and bathroom. Open the cupboard doors. Look for warping, staining, or that distinctive musty smell.
- **Behind furniture spots** — if there are marks on the walls where furniture clearly used to sit, look closely. Mould often grows behind wardrobes and beds pushed against cold exterior walls.
- **The bathroom ceiling** — is there an extractor fan? Does it work? Ask the agent to turn it on. If it sounds like a dying helicopter, it probably hasn't been maintained.

**What you're smelling for:**

Trust your nose. That damp, musty smell is moisture. If you can smell it during a viewing — when the place is empty and aired out — it's a problem.

> If the agent says "it just needs airing out" or "the previous tenants didn't ventilate properly," translate that as: "this flat has a moisture problem and I'm hoping you won't notice."

## Heating and insulation: your winter power bill

Under Healthy Homes, every rental needs a fixed heater in the main living area capable of warming it to at least 18°C. For most of Auckland, that means a heat pump or a wood burner — not a plug-in fan heater.

**What to look for:**

- **Is there a heat pump?** Where is it mounted? A heat pump in the hallway doesn't count for living room compliance.
- **What's the heater size?** A tiny 2kW unit in a large open-plan space won't cut it. Ask if you're unsure.
- **Ceiling insulation** — if there's roof access (like a manhole), ask if you can have a look. If not, ask for the insulation certificate.
- **Underfloor situation** — is it a timber floor on piles? In Auckland, underfloor insulation should be at least R1.3. Concrete slab foundations are naturally more stable but can be cold.
- **Double glazing** — not yet a Healthy Homes requirement, but makes a real difference to both warmth and condensation. Single glazing in a north-facing room is fine. Single glazing in a south-facing bedroom is a condensation factory.

**The window test:**

Put your hand near the window — especially if it's a cold day. Can you feel a draught? First-generation aluminium joinery from the 70s and 80s often fits poorly and has degraded seals. Gaps around the frame mean heat loss and moisture ingress.

**Why this matters for your wallet:**

A cold, poorly insulated flat at $550/week can cost you $250+/month in power over winter just to stay warm. A well-insulated place at $620/week might cost half that. Do the maths before you sign.

## Natural light and aspect

This is about more than aesthetics. North-facing living areas in Auckland stay warmer and drier. South-facing rooms are harder to heat and more prone to condensation.

**Check the orientation:**

- Which way does the main living area face? If you're unsure, use your phone compass.
- Are the bedroom windows getting any direct sunlight, or are they permanently in shadow?
- Are there buildings or trees blocking light?

**The afternoon test:**

If you're viewing in the afternoon, sunlight streaming in is a good sign. If it's midday and the place is dark with all the lights on, it'll be darker when you're actually home.

> A dark flat isn't just depressing — it's harder to keep dry. Sunlight is free heating and free mould prevention.

---

## Ventilation: can this place actually breathe?

Healthy Homes requires opening windows in living areas and bedrooms, plus extractor fans in the kitchen and bathroom. But "having" these things and "them actually working" are different.

**Quick checks:**

- **Try the windows.** Can you actually open them? Some painted-shut windows stay that way for years.
- **Check the extractor fans.** Turn them on. Do they work? Feel for airflow with your hand.
- **Cross-ventilation.** Are there windows on opposite or adjacent walls? Being able to create airflow through the flat makes a real difference in summer.
- **Bathroom windows.** If the bathroom has no window and a weak extractor, expect mould on the ceiling within six months.

---

## The noise factor

You'll live with whatever you hear during the viewing — except, in reality, probably worse. Viewings often happen at quiet times. 2pm on a Tuesday is not the same as 7am on a Saturday.

**What to listen for:**

- **Road noise.** If the flat faces a main road, stand still for a minute. Trucks, buses, motorbikes — they'll be your alarm clock.
- **Neighbours.** Thin walls in apartment buildings are common. If you can hear footsteps or voices during a viewing, you'll hear more when it's quiet at night.
- **Flight paths.** If you're near the airport or under a regular flight path, that sound becomes your constant background. Check FlightRadar24 for actual routes.
- **Schools and bars.** Both create predictable noise at specific times. Fine if you're never home then. Not fine otherwise.

**The quiet test:**

Ask the agent to be silent for 30 seconds while you just listen. Yes, it's a bit awkward. But it's your sanity for 12 months.

## The landlord responsiveness signal

How the agent or landlord behaves during the viewing and application tells you how they'll behave when your hot water cylinder dies in June.

**Good signs:**

- They know details about the property — insulation thickness, when the heat pump was serviced, who handles maintenance.
- They have the Healthy Homes compliance statement ready and offer it without being asked.
- They respond promptly to questions via email or phone.
- The property shows signs of active maintenance — not faded paint and a broken gate latch.

**Red flags:**

- They don't know basic details and say they'll "check with the owner."
- They brush off questions about maintenance or compliance.
- There's visible maintenance that's been left undone — broken letterbox, leaking tap during viewing, flaking exterior paint.
- They pressure you to apply immediately "before it goes."

> The landlord-tenant relationship is a business relationship. Start as you mean to continue. If they're hard to reach before you've signed, they won't get easier once you have.

## Practical stuff that'll annoy you later

These aren't necessarily deal-breakers, but they're the things you'll complain about for 12 months if you don't check:

**Power points:**

- How many are there? Are they where you need them?
- Older flats often have two power points per room — not great if you have a bedside table, lamp, phone charger, and laptop.
- Extension leads everywhere are a fire risk and a trip hazard.

**Internet connectivity:**

- Is there a fibre connection? Use the Chorus website to check availability for the address.
- Where's the router likely to go? Will you get decent Wi-Fi in your bedroom?
- If it's a multi-unit building, congestion can slow things down during peak hours.

**Storage:**

- Is there a wardrobe in the bedroom, or will you need to bring one?
- Is there covered parking or just a driveway spot?
- Any shed or external storage for bikes, surfboards, Christmas decorations?

**Laundry situation:**

- Is there a dedicated laundry space, or is the washing machine in the bathroom?
- Is there a dryer, or just a clothesline? In Auckland, a dryer or covered drying area is basically essential in winter.

**Water pressure:**

- Turn on the shower. Is the pressure decent? Old galvanised pipes can reduce flow to a trickle.
- Flush the toilet. Does it refill quickly?

## Before you leave: what to ask

Don't just absorb information passively. Ask questions. See how they're answered.

1. **"Can I see the Healthy Homes compliance statement?"** — If they hesitate or don't have it, ask when you can expect it. Legally, they must provide it.

2. **"How long has the property been listed?"** — You can check this on Trade Me, but asking tells you whether they're honest about it.

3. **"Why did the previous tenants leave?"** — A valid question. They might not answer, but evasiveness is a signal.

4. **"Who handles maintenance — you directly, or a property manager?"** — And then: "What's the typical response time for urgent repairs?"

5. **"Is there anything I should know about the property that isn't in the listing?"** — An open question that sometimes gets honest answers.

## After the viewing: doing your homework

The viewing is just the first filter. Before you apply, do a bit more due diligence.

**Check the listing history:**

Has this exact property been listed before — same photos, maybe at a different price? Repeated listings suggest either problem tenants (rare) or a problem landlord (more common).

**Search the address:**

Google the address. Sometimes you'll find old listings with different photos, or forum discussions, or news articles.

**Check the LIM:**

You can order a Land Information Memorandum from Auckland Council for around $350. Most renters won't do this. But if you're considering a long-term tenancy, especially in an unusual property, it can reveal consent history, building compliance issues, and weather tightness flags. Expensive, but cheaper than moving out after six months.

**Ask around:**

If you know anyone in the area, ask them. Neighbourhood intel is underrated.

## The bottom line

A rental viewing is a job interview — except you're the one doing the hiring. You're assessing whether this property and this landlord are worth your money and your time.

Most renters don't push back. They're grateful to be offered a tenancy and they don't want to seem difficult. Landlords and agents are used to this.

Don't be difficult. But don't be a pushover either.

Know what you're looking for. Ask the questions. Look in the corners. Trust your nose.

And if something feels off — if the place smells damp, if the landlord is evasive, if the "fixed heater" is a $50 panel heater screwed to the wall — walk away. There are other flats.

> Landlords know most renters won't push back. They rely on that. Don't give them the benefit of the doubt — make them earn it.
