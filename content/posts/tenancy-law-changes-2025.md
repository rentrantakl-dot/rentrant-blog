The Residential Tenancies Amendment Act 2024 came into effect on 30 January 2025. If you rent in New Zealand, these changes affect you — whether you've signed a new lease recently or you've been in the same flat for years.

Let's cut through the noise and talk about what actually changed, what it means in practice, and how to protect yourself.

## The Headline Change: 90-Day No-Cause Termination Is Back

This is the big one. Landlords can now end a periodic tenancy with 90 days' notice, without providing a reason.

**What this means:**
- Your landlord doesn't need to explain why they want you out
- You get 90 days from the date of the notice to find a new place
- This applies to periodic (rolling) tenancies, not fixed-term
- The notice must be in writing

**What this doesn't mean:**
- They can't kick you out with no notice (still 90 days minimum)
- They can't do this during a fixed-term lease
- They can't use this to discriminate or retaliate (though proving that is hard)

> If you were comfortable in a periodic tenancy because the old law required landlords to give a reason, that safety net is gone. It doesn't mean your landlord *will* end your tenancy — but they *could*, at any time, with 90 days' notice.

### Shorter Notice for Specific Reasons

Alongside the 90-day rule, there's now a 42-day notice option for specific situations:

| Reason | Notice Required |
|--------|-----------------|
| Owner wants to move in | 42 days |
| Property sold with vacant possession | 42 days |
| Property needed for employee accommodation | 42 days |
| Significant renovations/redevelopment | 42 days |

These existed before, but the 42-day timeframe is new (it was 63 days for some of these previously).

## What Changed for Tenants

### 21-Day Notice to Leave

Here's the flip side. You can now end a periodic tenancy with just **21 days' notice**.

Previously it was 28 days. This gives you a bit more flexibility if you need to move quickly — though finding a new place in 21 days in Auckland is still a stretch.

### Fixed-Term Tenancies: The New Default

The rules around fixed-term tenancies ending have changed:

**Old rule:** Fixed-term rolled to periodic automatically at the end, unless both parties agreed otherwise.

**New rule:** Fixed-term tenancies still roll to periodic automatically, BUT either landlord or tenant can give notice between 90 and 21 days before the end date to prevent this.

**Translation:**
- If you don't want a periodic tenancy (for whatever reason), give at least 21 days' notice before your fixed-term ends
- If your landlord doesn't want it to continue, they must give at least 90 days' notice before the end
- If neither party gives notice, it rolls to periodic

This matters because some renters prefer the security of a fixed-term. Now you need to be proactive if your fixed-term is ending and you want to renegotiate or lock in another term.

## Pet Bonds Are Now a Thing

From **1 December 2025**, landlords can charge a pet bond — an additional bond specifically for tenants with pets.

| Bond Type | Maximum |
|-----------|---------|
| Standard bond | 4 weeks' rent |
| Pet bond (additional) | 2 weeks' rent |
| **Total maximum with pet** | **6 weeks' rent** |

**How this works:**
- The pet bond is optional — landlords don't have to charge one
- It must be lodged with Tenancy Services like the normal bond
- It can only be used for pet-related damage (not normal wear and tear)
- You don't automatically get a pet bond back — it follows the same process as regular bond

> If you're renting with a pet at $600/week, you could now need to find up to $3,600 in bond money upfront. That's significant.

**The upside:** Some landlords who previously refused pets outright may now accept them, knowing they have the additional protection. Whether this happens in practice... we'll see.

## Changes to Tenancy Tribunal Damages

The Tenancy Tribunal can now award higher exemplary damages against landlords who deliberately breach their obligations:

| Landlord Size | Maximum Exemplary Damages |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| Smaller landlords (fewer than 6 properties) | $7,200 |
| Larger landlords (6+ properties) | $50,000 |

These aren't automatically awarded — you have to prove the landlord acted deliberately or recklessly. But the increased maximums are meant to create a real deterrent.

## What Didn't Change

A few things people sometimes get confused about:

- **Rent increases:** Still limited to once every 12 months, with 60 days written notice. No change.
- **Bond limits:** Still 4 weeks maximum (plus new pet bond option).
- **Healthy Homes:** Still fully required since 1 July 2025. Landlords must have compliance statements.
- **Retaliatory eviction:** Still technically prohibited — though now harder to prove.

## Practical Implications for Renters

### The Periodic vs Fixed-Term Question

This is now a bigger decision than it used to be.

**Periodic tenancy:**
- Flexibility — you can leave with 21 days' notice
- Risk — landlord can end it with 90 days' notice, no reason needed
- Good if: You might need to move, value flexibility

**Fixed-term tenancy:**
- Security — landlord can't end it early (except for serious breaches)
- Commitment — you're locked in for the term
- Good if: You want stability, don't plan to move

In the current market, some renters are asking for fixed-term leases specifically to protect against no-cause termination. If stability matters to you, this is worth negotiating.

### Documenting Everything

With landlords now able to terminate without cause, having a paper trail is more important than ever.

**Keep records of:**
- All communication with your landlord (email is best)
- Rent payments (bank statements showing regular payment)
- Maintenance requests and how they were handled
- The property condition (photos when you move in and regularly after)

Why? If your landlord does give you 90-day notice, a strong rental history helps you find the next place quickly. And if you suspect the termination is actually retaliation for something (like requesting repairs), documented communication is evidence.

### Reading Your Tenancy Agreement

The 2025 changes mean different things depending on your agreement type. Check:

- Is your tenancy fixed-term or periodic?
- When does your fixed-term end?
- Are there any special conditions about termination, pets, or renewal?

If you signed before January 2025, your existing terms still apply — but new law overrides old. A clause in an old agreement that contradicts the new rules won't be enforceable.

## What to Do If You Get 90-Day Notice

Don't panic. You have time.

1. **Check the notice is valid:** It must be in writing, dated, and give you the full 90 days from the date you receive it.
2. **Ask for an extension if needed:** Some landlords will agree to a slightly longer timeline, especially if you've been a good tenant.
3. **Start looking early:** 90 days sounds like a lot, but in Auckland, give yourself decent lead time.
4. **Know your rights on exit:** You don't owe anything extra. The process should be like any tenancy ending — inspection, bond return, etc.

If you think the notice is retaliation or discrimination, talk to [Community Law](https://communitylaw.org.nz/) or [Tenancy Services](https://www.tenancy.govt.nz/) before you do anything.

## The Balanced View

Look, these changes tilt things towards landlords more than the previous rules. That's just the reality.

But they're not draconian. Most landlords want stable, paying tenants — turnover costs them money too. The 90-day rule is there as an option, not a mandatory eviction cycle.

What matters is being informed. Knowing what your landlord can and can't do. Keeping good records. Thinking strategically about fixed vs periodic tenancies. And being a reliable tenant so you're the last person a reasonable landlord would want to move on.
