Since 1 July 2025, every rental property in New Zealand must comply with the Healthy Homes Standards. Not "should." Must.

If you're renting in Auckland right now, your landlord has had years of notice and no valid excuse for non-compliance. And yet — walk through any collection of Auckland rentals and you'll find plenty that don't quite meet the mark. Sometimes deliberately. Sometimes through neglect. Sometimes because the landlord genuinely doesn't understand what's required.

Here's the thing: the law is on your side. The Tenancy Tribunal is actively enforcing these standards, and tenants are winning significant payouts. But you need to know what to look for, how to document it, and what leverage you actually have.

## The five Healthy Homes Standards, explained simply

The standards cover five areas. Your rental needs to meet all of them — not just some.

### 1. Heating

**The rule:** A fixed heater in the main living room that can heat it to at least 18°C.

**What counts:**
- Heat pumps (most common)
- Wood burners or pellet burners
- Flued gas heaters
- Compliant electric heaters (but these need to be the right size — more on that below)

**What doesn't count:**
- Portable heaters (electric fan heaters, oil column heaters, etc.)
- Unflued gas heaters (they're actually banned in bedrooms and living rooms now)
- A heat pump in the hallway that "heats the whole house"

**The sizing issue:**

The heater has to be *capable* of heating the room to 18°C, not just *exist*. There's a tool on the MBIE website that calculates the minimum heating capacity based on room size, insulation level, and Auckland's climate zone. A small 2kW heater in a large open-plan living area won't cut it.

> If your landlord installed the cheapest compliant heat pump and your living room is still cold in winter, the heater might be undersized. The standard isn't just "has a heat pump" — it's "can actually warm the room."

### 2. Insulation

**The rule:** Ceiling and underfloor insulation must meet minimum R-values (a measure of insulation's resistance to heat flow).

For most Auckland rentals (Zone 1 and 2):
- **Ceiling insulation:** Existing insulation must be in reasonable condition; new installs require R2.9 or higher
- **Underfloor insulation:** R1.3 minimum

The required thickness varies depending on the insulation material — ask for the R-value, not just the depth.

**What to check:**
- Ask for the insulation statement — landlords are required to provide one
- If you can access the ceiling (through a manhole), you can visually check the insulation depth
- If the floor is cold even with heating, underfloor insulation might be missing or inadequate

**Exemptions:**

Some properties have exemptions — typically where installation is physically impossible (concrete slab floors, inaccessible ceiling cavities) or where insulation would cause damage to a heritage building. These exemptions should be documented in the compliance statement.

### 3. Ventilation

**The rule:** Openable windows in all habitable rooms, plus extractor fans in the kitchen and bathroom.

**Kitchen extractor:** Must vent to outside — recirculating rangehood filters don't count unless there's also an openable window nearby.

**Bathroom extractor:** Must either vent to outside or be in a bathroom with an openable window of at least 300mm × 300mm.

**The real-world check:**

- Can you actually open all the windows? Some are painted shut.
- Does the extractor fan actually extract? Hold a tissue near it — if it doesn't suck the tissue toward it, it's not really working.
- Can you create cross-ventilation (windows on opposite sides of the flat)?

### 4. Moisture ingress and drainage

**The rule:** Efficient drainage for surface water, groundwater, and stormwater. No moisture coming in from the ground, walls, or roof.

**Signs of problems:**
- Damp or musty smell
- Visible water staining on walls or ceilings
- Efflorescence (white powdery deposits) on concrete or masonry
- Pooling water around the property after rain
- Rising damp at the base of walls

**What landlords must do:**

If there's a moisture issue from a building defect (leaking roof, failed cladding, poor drainage), it's the landlord's responsibility to fix it. They can't just tell you to "open the windows more."

### 5. Draught stopping

**The rule:** No unnecessary gaps or holes in walls, ceilings, windows, floors, or doors that cause noticeable draughts.

**What this means:**
- Windows and doors should close properly and not have visible gaps
- Fireplaces that aren't in use should be blocked
- Obvious holes in walls (from old fittings, etc.) should be filled
- Ranch sliders shouldn't have daylight visible around the edges

**The common issue:** First-generation aluminium joinery from the 1970s–80s often fits poorly and has degraded rubber seals. Landlords are expected to install draught-stopping measures if the gaps are significant.

## How to check your rental's compliance

### Step 1: Ask for the compliance statement

Every landlord must provide a Healthy Homes compliance statement within 21 days of you moving in. If you're already in a tenancy and haven't received one, you can request it.

The statement should include:
- Which of the five standards the property meets
- How it meets them (e.g., type of heater, insulation R-values)
- Any exemptions and why

**If they don't provide one:** This is itself a breach. You can request one in writing. If they still don't provide it, this is grounds for a Tenancy Tribunal application.

### Step 2: Do your own visual inspection

Don't just take the statement at face value. Walk through the property with the standards in mind.

**For heating:**
- Is there a fixed heater in the living area? (Not portable, not in a hallway)
- Is it appropriately sized? Use the [MBIE heating assessment tool](https://www.tenancy.govt.nz/healthy-homes/heating-standard/heating-tool/) to check.

**For insulation:**
- Ask about the insulation type and depth
- If you have ceiling access, have a look (carefully — don't walk on ceiling joists)
- For underfloor, you might be able to see insulation through a subfloor vent

**For ventilation:**
- Check that all windows open
- Test extractor fans — do they actually extract?

**For moisture:**
- Look for damp smells, staining, mould, or musty air
- Check corners, under sinks, around windows

**For draughts:**
- On a windy day, can you feel air coming through window frames?
- Do doors close properly?

### Step 3: Document everything

If you find issues, document them before you raise them with the landlord.

- Take photos with timestamps
- Note the date and time of inspection
- If possible, video any issues that are hard to capture in a photo (e.g., a fan that doesn't work, a draught you can feel)

This documentation becomes your evidence if you need to go to the Tribunal.

## What to do if your rental isn't compliant

### Start with communication

Most issues can be resolved without escalation. Write to your landlord (or property manager) in writing — email is fine.

**Example email:**

> Hi [Landlord/Property Manager],
>
> I've reviewed the Healthy Homes standards and noticed that the property doesn't appear to meet the heating/insulation/ventilation/moisture/draught-stopping standard.
>
> Specifically: [describe the issue — e.g., "The bathroom has no working extractor fan and no openable window."]
>
> Under the Healthy Homes Standards, this should have been compliant since 1 July 2025. Could you please let me know when this will be addressed?
>
> I've attached photos documenting the issue.
>
> Cheers,
> [Your name]

Keep a copy of everything you send.

### If they don't respond or refuse

If your landlord ignores you or refuses to fix the issue, you have options:

1. **Contact Tenancy Services mediation:** Free, and often effective. The landlord is required to participate in good faith.

2. **Apply to the Tenancy Tribunal:** You can apply for an order requiring compliance, plus compensation for the period of non-compliance.

## What the Tribunal has actually awarded

The Tribunal is enforcing these standards. Here are real cases:

### The $8,957 Kāinga Ora case

A Wellington tenant successfully claimed against Kāinga Ora (government housing) for a property with inadequate heating and insulation. The Tribunal awarded:
- $8,000 in exemplary damages
- $957 in rent reduction
- An order requiring full compliance within 90 days

### Rent reductions for cold flats

In multiple Auckland cases, tenants have been awarded **20-40% rent reductions** for the period their flat was non-compliant with heating or insulation standards. If you've been paying full rent for a flat that doesn't meet the standards, you might be entitled to a partial refund.

### Exemplary damages: up to $7,200 for smaller landlords

The Tribunal can award exemplary damages of up to $7,200 under Section 45 of the Residential Tenancies Act. For landlords with six or more properties, penalties can be higher — up to $50,000. The $7,200 figure is typically the total maximum per application for smaller landlords, not per individual breach.

In practice, most awards are lower — but combined with rent reductions and compliance orders, the total can be significant.

> The Tribunal isn't messing around. Landlords who've ignored the July 2025 deadline are now facing real consequences.

## Common landlord excuses (and why they're weak)

### "I've applied for an exemption"

Exemptions exist, but they're narrow. They apply when compliance is physically impossible or would require unreasonable expense relative to the value of the building. "It's expensive" isn't enough.

If your landlord claims an exemption, ask to see the documentation.

### "The heater works fine — you just need to use it more"

The standard isn't about whether you use the heating. It's about whether the property is *capable* of reaching 18°C. If the heater is undersized or the insulation is poor, that's the landlord's problem.

### "The previous tenants never complained"

Irrelevant. The law changed. Compliance is mandatory.

### "We'll fix it when you move out"

Not good enough. Compliance was required from 1 July 2025, not "some unspecified future date."

### "Open the windows more to deal with moisture"

If moisture is coming from a building defect — leaking roof, failed cladding, poor drainage — ventilation won't fix it. Landlords can't blame tenant behaviour for structural problems.

## Your rights during the compliance period

While you're waiting for compliance issues to be fixed:

- **You can request a rent reduction** for the period of non-compliance. This is negotiable directly, or can be ordered by the Tribunal.
- **You can apply to the Tribunal** even if the landlord is "working on it." The Tribunal can set a deadline.
- **You cannot be evicted for asserting your rights.** If a landlord gives you notice shortly after you request compliance, that's potentially retaliatory termination — which is illegal.
