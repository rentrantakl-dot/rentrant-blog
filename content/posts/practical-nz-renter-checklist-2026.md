You’ve finally secured a rental and received an offer from the landlord. Getting approved can feel like winning a small lottery—after applications, references, and back-and-forth with property managers and landlords, it often comes down to a sense of luck.

That relief can lead to rushed decisions. The agreement you sign now will shape how comfortable your tenancy is—and how easy it is to exit later. This is the moment to slow down. While there is **no legal requirement** for landlords to provide advance review time, it is reasonable to insist on time to review a **draft** of the agreement before signing. This post highlights practical checks to make before the document is finalised, and clearly distinguishes between **legal requirements** and **best-practice advice**.

## Understand the tenancy agreement

A written tenancy agreement is a **legal requirement** for most residential rentals in New Zealand. It sets out the terms and obligations under which the property is rented and should be read carefully.

If you are a first-time renter, note that move-in costs typically include **bond and rent in advance**. Ensure you have sufficient cash available when these payments are due.

### Type of tenancy
The agreement must specify whether the tenancy is **fixed-term** or **periodic**.

Most rentals are initially offered as fixed-term tenancies (commonly 12 months). Landlords often prefer this for predictability and may prioritise tenants willing to commit to a fixed term.

### Rent and rent frequency
In New Zealand, rent is usually quoted weekly. Rent should be paid by bank transfer, and the landlord’s bank account details should be clearly stated in the agreement. This is standard practice and avoids disputes.

### Advance rent
By law, landlords may ask for **no more than two weeks’ rent in advance**. They cannot require further rent payments until the advance rent has been used up. Any request beyond this is unlawful.

### Bond expectations
Landlords may ask for a bond of up to **four weeks’ rent**. The bond must be lodged with **Tenancy Services within 23 working days**, and the landlord must provide a receipt and confirmation of lodgement.

### Rent reviews or increases
Rent increases are tightly regulated:
- Rent can generally only be increased **once every 12 months**.
- For **fixed-term tenancies**, rent can only be increased if the agreement explicitly allows it.
- Landlords must provide **at least 60 days’ written notice** of any increase.

Pay close attention to clauses covering what happens **after the fixed term ends**. If nothing changes, the tenancy typically rolls over to a **periodic tenancy**.

## Property inspection

This is one of the most important steps before signing, as it directly affects how easily you can exit the rental.

There is **no legal requirement** for inspections to occur before signing, but it is best practice to agree that the inspection happens **at least a day in advance**, giving you time to properly document issues.

### Notes on the agreement
Be meticulous. Walk through every room and record all existing damage directly on the agreement:

- Walls (all sides), doors (including behind doors), windows, and glass panes  
- Cracks, chips, stains, water marks, leak marks, and signs of mould—especially in bathrooms  
- Floors, ceilings, and fixtures

For all chattels listed in the agreement, confirm they work. If something is partially functional (for example, one burner on a gas hob not working), record it clearly. Note the overall cleanliness of the property and chattels.

The inspection applies to the **entire property**, including outdoor areas. Document the condition of lawns, gardens, and grounds to avoid disputes later.

Having another person present can help you stay focused. All notes should be mutually agreed and written into the agreement. Do not rely on goodwill—this is a legal document, and the person you deal with now may not be involved when you leave.

### Photographs
Written notes in the signed agreement are your primary protection, but take **supporting photographs** of all damage and wear.

Rename or tag photos promptly and store them securely. Context is easily forgotten over time, and clearly labelled photos can be invaluable at the end of the tenancy.

## More than Healthy Homes compliant

All rental properties must meet the **Healthy Homes Standards**. From **1 July 2025**, this requirement applies to *all* rentals. New or renewed tenancy agreements must include a **signed Healthy Homes compliance statement**.

Compliance is a legal minimum. It does not guarantee the home will be pleasant to live in.

### Heating
Landlords must provide compliant heating for at least the living room. If a fireplace is listed as the heating source, check that it appears usable and shows signs of recent use.

### Insulation
Insulation is part of Healthy Homes compliance, but it can be difficult to verify visually. Ask direct questions about insulation in the ceiling and underfloor areas, even if the landlord states the property is compliant.

### Ventilation and moisture
Healthy Homes Standards require adequate ventilation and measures to manage moisture and drainage. Check that bathrooms and kitchens have effective ventilation and look for signs of dampness or water pooling around the property.

---

## Understand responsibilities

Some obligations are set by law, while others are purely **contractual**. Read this section carefully.

### Lawns
Lawn maintenance is commonly assigned to tenants, but this is **not a legal requirement**—it must be stated in the agreement. Ask about current arrangements and estimate the ongoing cost when assessing value for money.

### Gardens
Garden maintenance is also contractual. Ensure expectations are clearly defined. It is better to clarify upfront than to discover later that significant work is expected.

### Cleaning and painting
There is **no fixed legal standard** requiring “deep cleaning” or painting on exit. Tenants are generally required to leave the property **reasonably clean and tidy**, allowing for fair wear and tear.

Confirm:
- Whether professional cleaning or painting was done before you move in  
- Whether the agreement imposes any additional obligations on exit

Be cautious of clauses that go beyond legal requirements.

## Things that do not show up on listings

Some important factors are rarely documented but can significantly affect daily life.

### Sunlight
Visit the property at different times of day to assess warmth and natural light. Nearby buildings or hills can limit sunlight. If multiple visits are not possible, tools like [Shadow Map](https://app.shadowmap.org/) can provide a rough guide.

### Transport
Check proximity to bus or train stations and confirm that routes actually work for your commute. A nearby stop with poor connectivity may still be impractical.

### Parking spots
With shared driveways or garages, confirm exactly what is included in the tenancy. Resolve any ambiguity before signing and ensure it is documented.

---

## Paperwork & compliance

### Communication channels
Ensure the agreement specifies clear communication channels. Having a documented email address for notices and maintenance requests makes disputes easier to manage.

### Agency payments — letting fees and key money
Letting fees charged to tenants are **illegal** in New Zealand, even when an agency is involved.  
Key money is generally prohibited, with limited exceptions (such as a lawful option fee). If money beyond rent and bond is requested, question it carefully.

### Breaking the tenancy
Understand the legal and contractual conditions for ending the tenancy early. Knowing this upfront reduces stress if circumstances change.

Taking the time to do these checks does not make you difficult—it makes you prepared. A calm, informed approach at the start of a tenancy is one of the most effective ways to protect your experience throughout.
