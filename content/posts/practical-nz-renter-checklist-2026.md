You've been approved for a rental. After all the applications and waiting, it feels like relief.

That relief often leads to rushed decisions. But the agreement you're about to sign will determine whether the next year is manageable or miserable. This is the moment to slow down. Think that BNZ ad with snails.

Most landlords will try to get you to sign immediately. There's no legal requirement for them to give you review time, but you can—and should—insist on it anyway. Here's what to check before the document is finalized.

---

## Before You Visit the Property

### Research the Address

Before you even book a viewing, do basic checks:

- **Check transport connections**—a bus stop nearby is useless if routes don't actually go where you need
- **Look at sunlight patterns** using [Shadow Map](https://app.shadowmap.org/)—nearby buildings or hills can leave places dark year-round
- **Google the property manager or landlord**—if their name appears in Tenancy Tribunal cases repeatedly, take note

**Cost estimate:**  
For a typical $600/week rental, you'll need around **$3,600 upfront** (4 weeks bond + 2 weeks advance rent). Make sure you have this available when payments are due—landlords usually want it within 48 hours of signing.

---

## During the Property Inspection

This is where most people make mistakes. They trust that problems will be sorted out later. They won't be.

### Get an Inspection Before Signing

There's **no legal requirement** for a pre-signing inspection, but insist on one anyway. If the landlord or property manager refuses, that's a red flag. Walk away.

Request the inspection **at least one day before signing**. You need time to review your notes and photos, not make snap decisions while standing in the living room.

**How to ask for it:**

Send an email:

> Hi [Property Manager],
> 
> Thanks for the offer. Before signing, I'd like to do a property inspection to document the current condition—standard practice to protect both parties.
> 
> Can we schedule this for [date], at least one day before signing? I'll bring the draft agreement to note any existing damage.
> 
> Let me know a time that works.
> 
> Cheers,  
> [Your name]

If they push back with "we don't do that" or "just sign and we'll sort issues later," don't believe them. You're about to hand over thousands of dollars. Act accordingly.

### What to Check (Room by Room)

Bring a printed checklist and walk through every room systematically. Don't rely on your memory.

**Walls and Ceilings:**
- Cracks, holes, or marks (note location: "bedroom 2, north wall, 1m from window")
- Water stains or discoloration (often hidden behind furniture—move it and look)
- Mould, especially in corners, around windows, behind beds
- Paint condition (peeling, bubbling, dirty marks)

**Windows and Doors:**
- Do all windows open and close properly?
- Are locks functional?
- Check for drafts (hold your hand near edges on a windy day)
- Look for cracked glass or damaged frames

**Floors:**
- Stains, scratches, worn patches
- Carpet damage or lifting edges
- Tiles: cracks or missing grout
- For wooden floors: gaps, warping, water damage

**Bathrooms and Kitchen:**
- **Mould is the big one**—check shower seals, under sinks, around taps, ceiling corners
- Water pressure (turn on taps, flush toilet)
- Does the shower drain properly? (ask to run it for 30 seconds)
- Check all appliances work: oven, hob, extractor fan, dishwasher
- Open cupboards: water damage, mould, pests

**Heating and Ventilation:**
- Is the heater installed and functional? (turn it on and confirm it actually heats)
- If it's a fireplace: does it look like it's been used recently? Soot marks, ash, clean flue?
- Bathroom and kitchen ventilation: does the fan actually work?
- Check for dampness: musty smell, condensation on windows

**Outdoor Areas:**
- State of lawns and gardens (you may be required to maintain these—note the current condition)
- Fences, gates, paths
- Drainage: any pooling water or obvious drainage problems?

**Chattels (appliances and furniture listed in the agreement):**
- Confirm everything listed actually exists
- Test everything: fridge, washing machine, dryer, dishwasher
- If something is broken or partially working (e.g., one stove element doesn't work), **write it down**

### Document Everything

**Written Notes:**  
Record all damage directly on the tenancy agreement. Be specific:
- ✅ "Bedroom 2, east wall, 40cm crack above window frame"
- ❌ "Some cracks in bedroom"

Both you and the landlord/property manager must sign off on these notes. Do not rely on verbal assurances that "we'll note that down later." If it's not written in the agreement you both sign, it doesn't exist.

**Photographs:**  
Take photos of everything you noted, plus:
- Wide shot of each room from the doorway
- Close-ups of all damage
- All chattels (showing they exist and work)
- Meter readings (power, water, gas if applicable)

**Photo Organization:**  
Don't just dump 100 photos in your camera roll. You'll forget what they show.

- Create a folder: `123-queen-st-move-in-04jan2026`
- Rename photos: `bedroom2-wall-crack-east.jpg`, `kitchen-oven-working.jpg`
- Do this **immediately** after the inspection while you remember what's what

Store photos somewhere safe (cloud backup, external drive). You'll need them when you move out.

## Understanding the Tenancy Agreement

Now you're actually reading the document. Here's what matters.

### Type of Tenancy

**Fixed-term** (usually 12 months):  
You and the landlord are both locked in for the specified period. You can't just leave early without consequences. The landlord can't kick you out unless you breach the agreement.

Landlords usually prefer fixed-term tenancies and may prioritize applicants who agree to one. If you're not sure you'll stay the full term, think carefully before committing.

**Periodic:**  
Either party can end the tenancy with proper notice (90 days for landlord to end without cause, 28 days for tenant). More flexibility, but less security.

Most rentals start as fixed-term, then automatically roll over to periodic when the term ends (unless the agreement says otherwise).

### Rent: What You're Actually Paying

Rent is usually quoted **weekly** in New Zealand (even though most people are paid monthly or fortnightly). Check the agreement states the weekly rate clearly.

**Payment method:**  
Should be by bank transfer. The landlord's bank account details must be in the agreement. If they want cash or anything else, ask why.

**Rent in advance:**  
Landlords can ask for **maximum 2 weeks' rent in advance**. Anything more than this is illegal. They cannot ask for more advance rent until the first lot has been used up.

**Bond:**  
Maximum **4 weeks' rent**. The bond must be lodged with Tenancy Services within **23 working days** of being paid. You should receive a receipt and a confirmation that it's been lodged. If the landlord doesn't lodge it, that's a problem—report it.

**Example upfront costs for a $600/week rental:**

| Item | Amount | Legal Limit |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Bond | $2,400 | 4 weeks max |
| Rent in advance | $1,200 | 2 weeks max |
| **Total due at signing** | **$3,600** | |

If they ask for $5,000+ upfront, something's wrong. Check the math.

### Rent Increases

Rent can generally only be increased **once every 12 months**, and landlords must give **at least 60 days' written notice**.

For **fixed-term tenancies**, rent can only be increased if the agreement explicitly allows it. If there's a rent increase clause, it should specify *how* the increase is calculated (e.g., CPI-linked, market review). Vague clauses like "rent may be increased at landlord's discretion" are potentially unenforceable.

Read the section about what happens **after the fixed term ends**. Often it just rolls to periodic, but some agreements include automatic rent increases or renewal terms. Know what you're agreeing to.

---

## Healthy Homes Compliance

From **1 July 2025**, all rental properties must meet Healthy Homes Standards. New or renewed tenancy agreements must include a **signed compliance statement**.

Compliance is the legal minimum. It does not mean the place will be warm, dry, or pleasant to live in. It just means it meets baseline standards.

### What to Check

**Heating:**  
Landlords must provide heating for at least the main living area. If the agreement lists a fireplace as the heating source, check:
- Does it look functional?
- Are there recent ash or soot marks (signs it's actually been used)?
- Is there firewood available?

A fireplace that hasn't been touched in years probably won't work when you need it.

**Insulation:**  
Required in ceiling and underfloor (where accessible). Hard to verify visually, but you can ask direct questions:
- "Is the ceiling fully insulated?"
- "Is there underfloor insulation?"
- "When was it installed?"

Even if the landlord says it's compliant, a cold house in winter tells you the real story.

**Ventilation:**  
Kitchens and bathrooms must have adequate ventilation. Check:
- Does the extractor fan actually work? (turn it on)
- Do windows open?

**Moisture and Drainage:**  
Check for:
- Pooling water outside
- Dampness inside (musty smell, wet patches)
- Condensation on windows
- Mould anywhere

If you see mould and the landlord dismisses it as "minor," trust your gut. Mould problems don't fix themselves.

**Get the compliance statement:**  
The landlord must provide a statement confirming the property meets Healthy Homes Standards, including the date of the last assessment. If they don't have one for an agreement starting after 1 July 2025, don't sign.

## Who's Responsible for What?

Some responsibilities are set by law. Others are purely contractual and can be negotiated (in theory—in practice, landlords usually won't budge).

### Lawns and Gardens

**Not a legal requirement** for tenants to maintain them, but most agreements include this anyway.

If the agreement says you're responsible for lawns:
- Note the current state during inspection (overgrown? well-maintained?)
- Estimate the cost: mowing, weeding, seasonal maintenance
- Factor this into whether the rent is actually a good deal

If you're expected to maintain a large section on top of paying $650/week, that's effectively higher rent.

Gardens are the same. If the agreement requires "maintaining gardens," clarify what that means:
- Regular weeding?
- Seasonal planting?
- Professional-level landscaping?

Get it in writing. "Just keep it tidy" is too vague.

### Cleaning and Painting on Exit

There's **no fixed legal standard** requiring professional cleaning or repainting when you leave.

You're generally required to leave the property **reasonably clean and tidy**, allowing for fair wear and tear.

**But:**  
If the property was professionally cleaned before you moved in, you may be expected to return it to similar condition. This is why documenting the move-in state matters.

If the agreement includes specific exit cleaning requirements (e.g., "must be professionally cleaned"), ask:
- Was it professionally cleaned before I moved in?
- Who pays for the exit clean? (spoiler: usually you)

Clauses requiring professional cleaning when the property wasn't professionally cleaned on entry are questionable. Tenancy Tribunal cases on this go both ways, so protect yourself with documentation.

Painting: You're not required to repaint unless you caused damage beyond normal wear (e.g., painting walls yourself without permission, nail holes everywhere). Faded paint from sunlight = fair wear and tear.

---

## Things That Don't Show Up on Listings

Some factors massively affect daily life but are rarely documented.

### Sunlight

A dark, cold house is miserable in winter. Visit at different times of day if possible, or use [Shadow Map](https://app.shadowmap.org/) to see how sunlight hits the property throughout the year.

Nearby tall buildings or hills can block sunlight completely, even if the listing says "sunny and bright."

### Noise

Stand quietly in each room for a minute. Listen for:
- Traffic noise
- Neighboring properties (voices, music, footsteps)
- Commercial activity (nearby bars, construction)

Visit on a weekday and a weekend if you can—noise patterns differ.

### Transport

Check that bus/train routes actually work for your commute. A bus stop 200m away is useless if:
- Buses only run every 2 hours
- The route doesn't go where you need
- Services stop early evening

Use AT Journey Planner (Auckland) or Metlink (Wellington) to verify.

### Parking

If the property includes parking, confirm exactly what's included:
- Dedicated space or shared driveway?
- How many cars?
- Visitor parking available?

Shared driveways can become territorial disputes. Get clarity upfront.

---

## Paperwork and Compliance

### Communication Channels

Ensure the agreement specifies how you'll communicate with the landlord/property manager:
- Email address for maintenance requests
- Email address for formal notices (ending tenancy, complaints)

Having documented communication channels makes disputes easier. "He said, she said" doesn't hold up. Emails do.

### Illegal Fees

**Letting fees** charged to tenants are **illegal** in New Zealand. Even if a property manager is involved, you should not be charged a letting fee.

**Key money** is generally prohibited (limited exceptions exist, like lawful option fees, but these are rare).

If you're asked to pay anything beyond rent and bond, question it carefully. "Administration fee," "application fee," "key deposit"—these are often just illegal letting fees with different names.

### Breaking the Tenancy Early

Fixed-term tenancies are binding. If you need to leave early, you're generally liable for rent until:
- The landlord finds a replacement tenant, or
- The fixed term ends

Some agreements include break clauses (e.g., "tenant may end tenancy early with 4 weeks' notice and payment of $X"). Read these carefully.

Understand the terms before signing. Life changes happen—new jobs, relationship breakdowns, family emergencies. Knowing your exit options upfront reduces stress if circumstances change.

---

## Utilities and Connections

Not usually covered in guides, but practically important.

**Before move-in:**
- Confirm which utilities are tenant vs. landlord responsibility (typically: tenant pays power/internet, landlord pays rates; water varies)
- Arrange power connection **1-2 weeks before move-in**, you are able to future date it (don't wait until the last day—it takes time to activate)
- Check internet availability at the address (fibre? VDSL? some areas have limited options)
- Take meter readings during inspection and compare to landlord's records

**Water:**  
In apartments, landlord often pays water and includes it in rent. In standalone houses, tenant usually pays. Confirm in writing.

---

## Renters Insurance

Landlord insurance covers the building, not your stuff.

If there's a fire, flood, or burglary, you're not automatically covered. Get **contents insurance**—usually $10-20/week depending on how much you own.

Some policies also cover accidental damage to the landlord's property (e.g., you spill red wine on the carpet). Worth considering.

Get quotes before moving in. You can't insure things after they're already lost.

---

## Red Flags: When to Walk Away

Even if you're desperate, some issues are non-negotiable:

❌ **Landlord refuses pre-signing inspection**  
If they won't let you document the property condition, they're planning to blame pre-existing damage on you later.

❌ **Requests more than 4 weeks bond or 2 weeks advance rent**  
Illegal. If they're breaking this rule upfront, expect more problems later.

❌ **Asks for "key money," "letting fee," or unexplained charges**  
Illegal. Don't pay it.

❌ **Visible mould that landlord dismisses as "minor"**  
Mould is a health hazard and indicates moisture problems. It will get worse, not better.

❌ **No Healthy Homes compliance statement** (for agreements after 1 July 2025)  
Required by law. If they don't have one, they're either non-compliant or disorganized. Either way, not your problem to solve.

❌ **Chattels listed in agreement don't exist or don't work**  
If the oven doesn't work and they say "we'll fix it after you move in," get it in writing with a deadline. Better yet, don't sign until it's fixed.

❌ **Pressured to sign immediately without review time**  
"Sign now or we'll give it to someone else" is a manipulation tactic. If the place is that in-demand, someone else can have it.

Trust your instincts. A bad landlord will make your life hell for a year. It's not worth it.

---

## If Things Go Wrong

You documented everything, but the landlord still isn't addressing problems noted during the inspection. What now?

1. **Email the landlord/property manager** with a list of issues and photos. Keep it factual, not emotional:
   > "During the inspection on [date], we documented the following issues: [list]. These were noted in the signed agreement. Please confirm when these will be addressed."

2. **Request a timeline** for repairs. Don't accept vague "we'll get to it" responses.

3. **Do not withhold rent.** Even if the landlord is non-compliant, withholding rent is illegal and gives them grounds to evict you.

4. **Escalate if needed.** Contact Tenancy Services (0800 836 262) for dispute resolution. They're free and can mediate.

If repairs affect habitability (no heating in winter, severe mould, no hot water), you may have grounds to end the tenancy early. Get advice from Tenancy Services or a community law centre before making that call.

Keep all correspondence. Emails, texts, photos—document everything. If it ends up in the Tenancy Tribunal, you'll need evidence.

## Final Thought

Taking time to do these checks doesn't make you difficult. It makes you smart.

Landlords know most renters won't push back. They rely on that. Don't give them the benefit of the doubt—make them earn it.

The person showing you around might seem friendly and reasonable. Great. But when you move out and want your bond back, you'll be dealing with whoever is managing the property at that point. Protect yourself now with documentation, because verbal promises won't help you later.

If you've rented before, [rate the property on RentRant](https://rentrant.nz). Future tenants deserve to know what you experienced. If you're about to rent, check if we have information on the address. It might save you from making a bad decision.
